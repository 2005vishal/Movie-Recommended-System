Overview
The Movie Recommender System is a machine learning project that provides personalized movie recommendations based on a similarity matrix. The project utilizes precomputed similarity scores between movies and allows users to input their favorite movies, returning a list of movies that are similar. It is built using Streamlit for the front-end interface and NumPy/Pandas for data processing.

This project demonstrates how content-based recommendation systems work by utilizing vector similarity techniques.

- Features
ðŸ“½ Movie Recommendation: Get movie suggestions based on your selected movie.
ðŸŽ¨ Interactive Interface: Streamlit-based GUI with an easy-to-use dropdown menu for selecting movies.
ðŸš€ Fast Recommendations: Precomputed similarity scores make the recommendation process efficient.
Demo

- Dataset
Movies Dataset: The movie dataset consists of movie titles and other metadata used to calculate similarities.
Similarity Matrix: A precomputed similarity matrix is split into 5 parts and loaded during the app initialization.

Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

Step-by-Step Installation
Clone the Repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-repo/movie-recommender-system.git
cd movie-recommender-system
Create and Activate Virtual Environment:


python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Required Dependencies: Install all required libraries using the provided requirements.txt file.


pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application: To launch the app, run:


streamlit run app.py
Open in Browser: After running the above command, Streamlit will start the app, and a URL will be provided in the terminal. Open that URL in your browser to access the app.

# Usage
After the app loads, you'll see a dropdown to select a movie.
Choose a movie you like from the list.
Click the Recommend button to get the top 5 movie recommendations.
The recommended movies will be displayed below the button, showing similar movies based on your input.
Technical Details
This recommender system is built using content-based filtering. The movies' similarity matrix is calculated using features like genres, cast, crew, and other movie metadata. The similarity matrix is precomputed to optimize performance and is split into multiple parts to manage memory efficiently.

# Libraries Used:
Streamlit: For building the interactive web interface.
Pandas: For handling and processing the movies dataset.
NumPy: For handling the similarity matrix and numerical computations.
Pickle: For loading precomputed data structures efficiently.
Future Enhancements
Add movie posters to enhance the visual experience.
Include movie genres and descriptions with each recommendation.
Explore using collaborative filtering or hybrid recommendation techniques to further improve recommendation accuracy.
